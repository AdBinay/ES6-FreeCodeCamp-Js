//  Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects

/*You can use the same principles from the previous two lessons to destructure values from nested objects.

Using an object similar to previous examples:

const user = {
  johnDoe: { 
    age: 34,
    email: 'johnDoe@freeCodeCamp.com'
  }
};
Here's how to extract the values of object properties and assign them to variables with the same name:

const { johnDoe: { age, email }} = user;
And here's how you can assign an object properties' values to variables with different names:

const { johnDoe: { age: userAge, email: userEmail }} = user;
Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables lowToday and highToday the values of today.low and today.high from the LOCAL_FORECAST object. */


const LOCAL_FORECAST = {
    yesterday: { low: 61, high: 75 },
    today: { low: 64, high: 77 },
    tomorrow: { low: 68, high: 80 }
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  const { today: { low: lowToday, high: highToday } } = LOCAL_FORECAST;
  // Only change code above this line
